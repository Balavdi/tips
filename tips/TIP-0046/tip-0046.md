# Summary

The Tangle is the graph data structure behind IOTA. For the Stardust upgrade an additional abstraction layer on top of
legacy IOTA version transactions was introduced where the vertices are generalized _blocks_, which then contain the
transactions or other structures that are processed by the IOTA protocol. Just as before, each block directly approves
other blocks, which are known as _parents_. The new block structure matches the requirements introduced by the IOTA 2.0
version of the protocol. A new type of block is introduced, the _Validation Block_. It is a special type of block that
is used by validators. Validation Blocks have additional functionality and different fields, validation rules, and
allowed payloads. To better distinguish the _Validation Block_ from the previously introduced _Block_, the latter is
renamed to _Basic Block_. A _Basic Block_ can contain different types of payloads which are processed by all nodes as
part of the IOTA protocol. Some payloads may have other nested payloads embedded inside. Hence, parsing is done layer by
layer.

# Motivation

To better understand this layered design, consider the Internet Protocol (IP), for example: There is an Ethernet frame
that contains an IP payload. This in turn contains a TCP packet that encapsulates an HTTP payload. Each layer has a
certain responsibility and once this responsibility is completed, we move on to the next layer.

The same is true with how blocks are parsed. The outer layer of the block enables the mapping of the block to a vertex
in the Tangle and allows us to perform some basic validation. The next layer may be a transaction that mutates the
ledger state, and one layer further may provide some extra functionality on the transactions to be used by applications.

By making it possible to add and exchange payloads, an architecture is being created that can easily be extended to
accommodate future needs.

# Building Blocks

This section describes common building blocks used across multiple block types.

## Data Types & Subschema Notation

Data types and subschemas used throughout this TIP are defined in [TIP-21](../TIP-0021/tip-0021.md).

## BLAKE2b Hash Function

This TIP uses the [BLAKE2b-256](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7693) hash function.

## Ed25519 Signature Scheme

This TIP uses Ed25519 signatures according to [RFC 8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032).

## Block ID

A Block ID denotes an identifier of a block, with type `ByteArray[40]`. It is created from three separately spelled out
fields due to commitment proof requirements to keep attestation proofs lightweight. It is calculated with the following
steps:

- Let `Block Header Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash over the serialized block header.
- Let `Block Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash over the serialized content of the _Block_ field.
- Let `Serialized Signature` be the serialized _Signature_.
- Let `ID` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the concatenation of `Block Header Hash`, `Block Hash` and `Serialized Signature`.
- Let `Slot Index` be the slot index of the `Issuing Time` of the block.
- Let `Serialized Slot Index` be the little-endian serialized `Slot Index`.
- Let `Block ID` be the concatenation of `ID` and `Serialized Slot Index`.

The string format of the Block ID is the hexadecimal encoding of the `Block ID` with a `0x` prefix.

## Time

Protocol time is divided into slots and epochs. And epoch consists of `2^(Slots Per Epoch Exponent)` slots and each slot
is `Slot Duration In Seconds` seconds in length.

### Slot Index

Each slot has a corresponding slot index, which is a `uint64`. To calculate the slot index of a timestamp, the protocol
parameters `Genesis Unix Timestamp` and `Slot Duration In Seconds` are used. The slot index of a Unix timestamp
`Unix Timestamp` is `(Unix Timestamp - Genesis Unix Timestamp)/Slot Duration In Seconds + 1`. Slots are counted starting
from `1` with `0` being reserved for the genesis, which has to be addressable as its own slot.

### Epoch Index

Each epoch has a corresponding epoch index, which is a `uint64`. To calculate the epoch index of a slot index, that is,
the index of the epoch to which the slot belongs, the protocol parameter `Slots Per Epoch Exponent` is used. The epoch
index of a slot index `Slot Index` is `(Slot Index >> Slots Per Epoch Exponent) + 1`, where `>>` is the _zero-fill
right-shift_ or _logical shift_ operation.

## Slot Commitment

A Slot Commitment contains a summary of a slot. The Slot Commitment is serialized as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Index</td>
    <td>uint64</td>
    <td>
      The slot index.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prev ID</td>
    <td>ByteArray[40]</td>
    <td>The slot identifier of the previous slot in the chain.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Roots ID</td>
    <td>ByteArray[32]</td>
    <td>The Merkle Tree Root of all commitment elements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cumulative Weight</td>
    <td>uint64</td>
    <td>The weight of the chain of the <code>Index</code> minus <code>Maximum Committable Age</code> slots in the past. This is required for attestations on whether to switch slot commitment chains.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Slot Commitment ID

A Slot Commitment ID denotes an identifier of a slot commitment, with type `ByteArray[40]`. It is calculated with the
following steps:

- Let `Content` be the serialized slot commitment.
- Let `Content Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash of `Content`.
- Let `Slot Index` be the slot index of the slot commitment.
- Let `Serialized Slot Index` be the little-endian serialized `Slot Index`.
- Let `Commitment ID` be the concatenation of `Content Hash` and `Slot Index`.

The string format of a Slot Commitment ID is the hexadecimal encoding of the Slot Commitment ID with `0x` prefix.

### Semantic Validation

- The `Index` of the commitment must be in the closed interval
  `[BlockSlot-MaxCommittableAge, BlockSlot-MinCommittableAge]`, where `BlockSlot` is the slot index corresponding to the
  `Issuing Time` of the block containing the commitment.

## Signature

The _Ed25519 Signature_ is supported. It is serialized as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>uint8</td>
    <td>
      Set to <strong>value 0</strong> to denote an <i>Ed25519 Signature</i>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Public Key</td>
    <td>ByteArray[32]</td>
    <td>The Ed25519 public key of the signature.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Signature</td>
    <td>ByteArray[64]</td>
    <td>The Ed25519 signature computed according to <a href="#signature-creation">Signature Creation</a>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Signature Creation

The _Signature_ field over the block is computed as follows:

- Let `Block Header Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash over the serialized block header.
- Let `Block Hash` be the BLAKE2b-256 hash over the serialized content of the _Block_ field.
- Let `Signing Input` be the concatenation of `Block Header Hash` and `Block Hash`.
- Let the resulting signature be the Ed25519 signature of `Signing Input`.

**Semantic Validation**

In order for the signature to be valid all of the following conditions must hold:

- The `Public Key` must verify the `Signature`, according to [TIP-14](../TIP-0014/tip-0014.md).
- The `Public Key` must be included as a _Block Issuer Key_ in the Account identified by the block's `Issuer ID` field.
  This check is executed against the account state at the slot index corresponding to the slot commitment of the block.

# Blocks

## Block Wrapper

The two block types introduced in this TIP share some common fields which are contained in an outer wrapper. This _Block
Wrapper_ is only introduced as a way to deduplicate the definition of those fields. It is not a standalone block type.

All fields of a _Block Wrapper_ except for the _Block_ and _Signature_ constitute the _Block Header_.

The _Block Wrapper_ is serialized as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Protocol Version</td>
    <td>uint8</td>
    <td>This field denotes what protocol rules apply to the block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Network ID</td>
    <td>uint64</td>
    <td>Network identifier. Usually, it will be set to the first 8 bytes of the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the concatenation of the network type and the protocol version string.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Issuing Time</td>
    <td>uint64</td>
    <td>The time at which the block was issued. It is a Unix timestamp in nanoseconds.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Slot Commitment ID</td>
    <td>ByteArray[40]</td>
    <td>The identifier of the slot this block commits to. More details in the <a href="#slot-commitment-id">Slot Commitment ID section</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Latest Finalized Slot</td>
    <td>uint64</td>
    <td>The slot index of the latest finalized slot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Issuer ID</td>
    <td>ByteArray[32]</td>
    <td>The identifier of the account that issued this block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Block <code>oneOf</code></td>
    <td colspan="2">
      <details>
        <summary>Basic Block</summary>
        <blockquote>
          A Basic Block. More details in the <a href="#basic-block">Basic Block section</a>.

      </details>
      <details>

        </blockquote>
      </details>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Signature <code>oneOf</code></td>
    <td colspan="2">
      <details>
        <summary>Ed25519 Signature</summary>
        <blockquote>
          An Ed25519 Signature. More details in the <a href="#slot-commitment">Signature section</a>.
        </blockquote>
      </details>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Basic Block

The _Basic Block_ uses the introduced [Block ID](#block-id) as its identifier.

### Serialized Layout

The serialized layout of a _Basic Block_ is that of a _Block Wrapper_ with the _Block_ field containing the following
layout:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>uint8</td>
    <td>Set to <strong>value 0</strong> to denote a <i>Basic Block</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Strong Parents Count</td>
    <td>uint8</td>
    <td>The number of blocks that are strongly directly approved.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Strong Parents <code>anyOf</code></td>
    <td colspan="2">

            <td>ByteArray[40]</td>
            <td>The Block ID of the strong parent.</td>

  </tr>
</table>

### Syntactic validation

The Tangle can only contain syntactically valid blocks. Invalid blocks must be rejected by the node. The following
criteria defines whether the block passes the syntactic validation:

- The total length of the serialized block must not exceed `Max Block Length`.
- `Type` must comply with the allowed block types for the `Protocol Version` config parameter of the node.
  - It must hold true that 1 ≤ `Strong Parents Count` ≤ 8.
  - It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Weak Parents Count` ≤ 8.
  - It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Shallow Like Parents Count` ≤ 8.
- `Strong Parents`, `Weak Parents`, `Shallow Like Parents` must comply with the following rules:
  - must be lexically ordered.
  - must not have duplicates in each list.
- `Weak Parents` must be disjoint to the rest of the parents, no weak parent should be in either strong or shallow like
  parents.
- Each `Block ID` must be unique.
- Payload (if present):
  - `Payload Type` must match one of the values described under [Payloads](#payloads).
  - `Data Fields` must be correctly parsable in the context of the `Payload Type`.
  - The payload itself must pass syntactic validation.
- There must be no trailing bytes after all block fields have been parsed.

### Semantic Validation

- The `Signature` must pass semantic validation.
- If a `Block` contains a transaction payload, the following conditions must be checked.
  - The Slot Index, `BlockSlot`, corresponding to the `Issuing Time` of a block must be greater or equal than the
    `Creation Slot` of the contained transaction.
  - If the transaction includes a `Commitment Input`, the `Slot Index` field of the commitment to which the input
    resolves must be in the closed interval `[BlockSlot-MaxCommittableAge, BlockSlot-MinCommittableAge]`

### Payloads

While blocks without a payload, i.e. `Payload Length` set to zero, are valid, such blocks do not contain any
information. As such, blocks usually contain a payload. The detailed specification of each payload type is out of scope
of this TIP. The following table lists all currently specified payloads that can be part of a block and links to their
specification:

| Payload Name | Type Value | TIP                               |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| No Payload   | -          | -                                 |
| Tagged Data  | 5          | [TIP-23](../TIP-0023/tip-0023.md) |
| Transaction  | 7          | [TIP-45](../TIP-0045/tip-0045.md) |

## Validation Block

A Validation Block is a special type of block used by validators to secure the network. It is recognised by the
Congestion Control of the IOTA 2.0 protocol and can be issued without burning Mana within the constraints of the allowed
validator throughput. It is allowed to reference more parent blocks than a normal _Basic Block_. _Validation Block_ uses
the introduced [Block ID](#block-id) as its identifier.

### Serialized Layout

The serialized layout of a _Validation Block_ is that of a _Block Wrapper_ with the _Block_ field containing the
following layout:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

  </tr>
</table>

### Syntactic validation

The Tangle can only contain syntactically valid blocks. Invalid blocks must be rejected by the node. The following
criteria defines whether the block passes the syntactic validation:

- The total length of the serialized block must not exceed `Max Block Length`.
- `Type` must comply with the allowed block types for the `Protocol Version` config parameter of the node.
  - It must hold true that 1 ≤ `Strong Parents Count` ≤ 50.
  - It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Weak Parents Count` ≤ 50.
  - It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Shallow Like Parents Count` ≤ 50.
- `Strong Parents`, `Weak Parents`, `Shallow Like Parents` must comply with the following rules:
  - must be lexically ordered.
  - must not have duplicates in each list.
- `Weak Parents` must be disjoint to the rest of the parents, no weak parent should be in either strong or shallow like
  parents.
- Each `Block ID` must be unique.
- `Payload Length` must be 0 and the `Payload` must not be present.
- There must be no trailing bytes after all block fields have been parsed.

### Semantic Validation

- The `Signature` must pass semantic validation.

# Rationale and alternatives

**Block ID & Signature**

Splitting the signing input of a Block Signature into a header and block part allows for verification of an attestation
where only the header and block hash are known. In a similar way, a Block ID can be recomputed from an attestation
without having the entire block.

**Validation Block**

The alternative could be to use a `Block` instead of `Validation Block` with some additional validation logic. However,
having a separate block type for validator related responsibilites is much cleaner and allows for additional changes
like allowing to reference more parents, or having specific payload types or fields in the future.

**Burned Mana**

The rationale for including the `Burned Mana` field on the block is the following. For a given block, the account
identified by the `Issuer ID` field on the block needs to burn the amount of Mana corresponding to the RMC and the block
size. A malicious node might provide a false, lower RMC value. If the field was not present, the required Mana would be
deducted from the account's Block Issuance Credit (BIC), but the account would not allot enough Mana in the containing
transaction, since it assumed a lower RMC value. This would result in a negative BIC balance and the locking of the
account. The `Burned Mana` field prevents this situation by effectively stating the assumption under which the account
operates. If `Burned Mana` is lower than it should be, the block can simply be dropped without incurring a cost for the
issuing account. Thus, as long as `Burned Mana` matches the amount allotted in the contained transaction, the
transaction will never result in the locking of the account.
